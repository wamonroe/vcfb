- Support rendering of the base form tag via component.
- Support rendering of slots for button, label, collection checkbox label, and
  collection radio button label components.
- Extracted form component logic out of generated components to ease future
  updates.
- Added the `vcfb:initializer` generator.

> **Note**: If you've previously run the component generator, you'll need to
> re-run it and merge the changes into your existing components.
